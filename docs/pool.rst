Caller Pool
===========

The Alarm service maintains a pool of bonded callers who are responsible for
executing scheduled calls.  By joining the caller pool, an account is
committing to executing scheduled calls in a reliable and consistent manner.
Any caller who reliably executes the calls which are allocated to them will
make a consistent profit from doing so, while callers who don't get removed
from the pool and forfeit some or all of their bond.

The Caller Pool is handled by a separate contract.  This contract is deployed
by the Alarm service contract during creation.  The address of this contract
can be retrieved with the ``getCallerPoolAddress`` function on the Alarm
service.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``getCallerPoolAddress() returns (address)``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0x662fc8a0``

This returns the appropriate address to use for interacting with the Caller
Pool.

Caller Bonding
--------------

In order to execute scheduled calls, callers put up a small amount of ether up
front.  This bond, is held for the duration that a caller remains in the caller
pool.

Minimum Bond
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The bond amount is set as the maximum allowed transaction cost for a given
block.  This value can be retrieved with the ``getMinimumBond`` function.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``getMinimumBond() returns (uint)``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0x23306ed6``

This value can change from block to block depending on the gas price and gas
limit.

Depositing your bond
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``depositBond`` function on the Caller Pool to deposit ether towards
your bond.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``depositBond()``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0x741b3c39``

Checking bond balance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``callerBonds`` function to check the balance of your bond.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``callerBonds(address) returns (uint)``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0xc861cd66``


Withdrawing your bond
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``withdrawBond`` function on the Caller Pool to withdraw the bond
ether.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``withdrawBond()``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0xc3daab96``

Bond funds are locked and cannot be withdrawn while a caller is in either the
current active pool or the queued pool.


Bond Forfeiture
---------------

In the event that a caller fails to execute a scheduled call during their
allocated call window, a portion of their bond is forfeited and they are
removed from the caller pool.  The amount forfeited is equal to the current
minimum bond amount.

There are no restrictions on re-entering the caller pool as long as a caller is
willing to put up a new bond.


About Pools
-----------

The Caller Pool contract maintains a lists of caller addresses.  Whenver a
change is made to the pool, either addition of a new member or removal of an
existing member, a new pool is queued to take place of the current pool 512
blocks in the future.  The new pool has all of the previous pool's members plus
or minus whatever additions or removals take place.

During the first 256 blocks prior to a queued pool becoming active, additional
members may choose to enter or leave.  The state of the queued pool becomes
frozen and cannot be changed starting at the 256 blocks leading up to the pool
becoming active.

Once the queued pool becomes active, members are once again allowed to enter
and exit the pool.

Each time a new pool is created, the ordering of its members is shuffled.

.. note::
    It is worth pointing out that from the block during which you exit the
    pool, you must still execute the calls that are allocated to you for the
    next 512 blocks until the new queue becomes active.  Failing to do so will
    cause bond forfeiture.


Entering the Pool
-----------------

An address can enter the caller pool if the following conditions are met.

* The caller has deposited the minimum bond amount into their account with the
  Caller Pool.
* The caller is not in the active pool, or the next queued pool.
* The next queued pool does not go active within the next 256 blocks.

To enter the pool, call the ``enterPool`` function on the Caller Pool.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``enterPool()``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0x50a3bd39``

If the appropriate conditions are met, you will be added to the next caller
pool.  This will create a new pool if one has not already been created.
Otherwise you will be added to the next queued pool.

You can use the ``canEnterPool`` function to check whether a given address is
currently allowed to enter the pool.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``canEnterPool(address callerAddress) returns (bool)``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0x8dd5e298``


Exiting the Pool
----------------

An address can exit the caller pool if the following conditions are met.

* The caller is in the current active pool.
* The caller has not already exited or been removed from the queued pool (if it
  exists)
* The next queued pool does not go active within the next 256 blocks.

To exit the pool, use the ``exitPool`` function on the Caller Pool.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``exitPool()``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0x50a3bd39``

If all conditions are met, a new caller pool will be queued if one has not
already been created and your address will be removed from it.

You can use the ``canExitPool`` function to check whether a given address is
currently allowed to exit the pool.

* **Soldity Function Signature:** ``canExitPool(address callerAddress) returns (bool)``
* **ABI Signature:** ``0xb010d94a``
