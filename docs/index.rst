Welcome to Ethereum Alarm Clock's documentation!
================================================

The Ethereum Alarm Clock is a service that allows scheduling of contract
function calls at a specified block number in the future.  These scheduled
calls are then executed by other nodes on the ethereum network who are
reimbursed for their gas costs plus a small payment for the transaction.
